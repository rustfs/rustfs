# Architecture Migration Progress

Status values: `[ ]` not started, `[~]` in progress, `[x]` complete, `[!]` blocked.

## Current Context

- Issue: [`rustfs/backlog#660`](https://github.com/rustfs/backlog/issues/660)
- Branch: `overtrue/arch-storage-api-error-contracts`
- Baseline: `upstream/main` at `5fef10548477d9d25b0d391874f8280bf259d10e`
- PR type for this branch: `contract`
- Runtime behavior changes: none.
- Rust code changes: add the `rustfs-storage-api` error-code/result contract
  and route ECStore storage error numeric conversion through that contract.
- CI/script changes: none
- Docs changes: record the API-002 first-slice contract boundary.

## Phase 0 Tasks

- [x] `G-001` Refresh `main` and record baseline.
  - Acceptance: baseline commit, title, and branch are recorded.
  - Verification: `git fetch upstream main --prune`; `git rev-parse upstream/main`.
- [x] `G-002` Create migration tracking checklist.
  - Acceptance: this file records task state, context, verification, and handoff.
- [x] `G-003` Classify PR types.
  - Acceptance: [`crate-boundaries.md`](crate-boundaries.md) lists exactly one
    allowed PR type per PR.
- [x] `G-004` Define re-export and wrapper policy.
  - Acceptance: temporary compatibility code must use `RUSTFS_COMPAT_TODO`.
- [x] `G-005` Add dependency direction guard.
  - Acceptance: `./scripts/check_layer_dependencies.sh` passes on current
    `upstream/main` while still rejecting new unaccepted layer dependencies.
- [~] `G-006` Create migration loss-prevention checks.
  - Current branch: add a mechanical admin route matrix guard from
    [`admin-route-action-snapshot.md`](admin-route-action-snapshot.md) and
    `rustfs/src/admin/route_registration_test.rs`.
  - Remaining follow-up: add checks for public re-export and storage trait
    coverage before pure moves.
- [x] `G-007` Create startup timeline table.
  - Acceptance: [`startup-timeline.md`](startup-timeline.md) records current
    binary startup order, side effects, fatal boundaries, and readiness stages.
- [x] `G-008` Capture admin route-action snapshot.
  - Acceptance: [`admin-route-action-snapshot.md`](admin-route-action-snapshot.md)
    records current route families, handler ownership, authorization actions,
    public exceptions, table-catalog routes, and `/minio/admin` compatibility
    alias behavior.
- [x] `G-009` Enforce pre-push three-expert review.
  - Acceptance: [`crate-boundaries.md`](crate-boundaries.md) requires
    quality/architecture, migration-preservation, and testing/verification review
    before push.
- [x] `G-010` Inventory `ecstore::config::{Config, KV, KVS}` consumers.
  - Acceptance:
    [`ecstore-config-consumer-inventory.md`](ecstore-config-consumer-inventory.md)
    records the current model definitions, global accessors, persistence helpers,
    consumer groups, migration risks, and do-not-change contract.
- [x] `TEST-PRTYPE-001` Check PR type enum consistency.
  - Acceptance: `./scripts/check_architecture_migration_rules.sh` parses the
    allowed PR types from [`crate-boundaries.md`](crate-boundaries.md) and fails
    when `ARCHITECTURE.md` or architecture docs reference an unknown PR type.
- [x] `COMPAT-REG-001` Check temporary compatibility cleanup consistency.
  - Acceptance: `./scripts/check_architecture_migration_rules.sh` fails when a
    source `RUSTFS_COMPAT_TODO(<task-id>)` marker lacks a cleanup-register entry,
    when a register entry lacks a source marker, or when a source marker omits a
    removal condition.

## Phase 1 Security Governance Tasks

- [x] `S-001` Add `crates/security-governance`.
  - Acceptance: the crate is a workspace member and has no dependency on
    `rustfs`, `ecstore`, admin handlers, Axum, or runtime state.
  - Verification: `cargo check -p rustfs-security-governance`.
- [x] `S-002` Add admin route matrix core types.
  - Acceptance: `AdminRouteSpec`, `AdminRouteAccess`, `AdminActionRef`,
    `PublicRouteKind`, `RouteRiskLevel`, and validation errors model route
    governance metadata without registering routes or enforcing auth.
  - Verification: `cargo test -p rustfs-security-governance`.
- [x] `S-003` Add redaction contract types.
  - Acceptance: `RedactionRule`, `RedactionLevel`, and validation errors model
    sensitive field handling without logging, masking, or runtime integration.
  - Verification: `cargo test -p rustfs-security-governance`.
- [x] `S-004` Add serde policy marker types.
  - Acceptance: `SerdePolicy`, `SerdePolicyKind`, `UnknownFieldPolicy`, and
    validation errors model strict ingress and compatibility serde contracts
    without changing deserialization behavior.
  - Verification: `cargo test -p rustfs-security-governance`.
- [x] `S-005` Add supply-chain policy contract types.
  - Acceptance: `ArtifactIntegrityPolicy`, `ArtifactSourceKind`, and validation
    errors model digest, signature, and provenance requirements without changing
    release or CI behavior.
  - Verification: `cargo test -p rustfs-security-governance`.
- [x] `S-006` Add `rustfs/src/admin/route_policy.rs` backed by these contract
  types, without changing route registration or auth behavior.
  - Acceptance: direct `AdminRouteSpec` entries cover routes with a single
    stable admin policy action, deferred inventory records routes that need
    richer contract support, and tests prove the combined inventory covers every
    registered admin route.
- [x] `S-011` Add KMS action taxonomy.
  - Acceptance: `KmsAction` can parse and serialize dedicated configure,
    service-control, clear-cache, generate-data-key, delete, rotate, list, and
    describe actions; wildcard matching still works.
  - Verification: `cargo test -p rustfs-policy action --no-fail-fast`.
- [x] `S-012` Migrate KMS handlers to dedicated actions.
  - Acceptance: KMS data-key, delete/cancel-delete, cache, configure,
    service-control, list, and describe handlers use dedicated `kms:*` actions.
  - Compatibility: legacy KMS create/status admin actions are retained only as
    temporary compatibility paths and registered in
    [`compat-cleanup-register.md`](compat-cleanup-register.md).
  - Verification: focused handler and route policy tests, migration rules,
    formatting, and `make pre-commit`.
- [x] `S-013` Apply KMS redaction.
  - Acceptance: KMS Debug output and admin status response summaries contain no
    Vault token, AppRole secret ID, or local master key values.
  - Must preserve: internal KMS config values remain available to runtime code
    and persisted config serialization still writes the original secret values.
  - Verification: focused KMS redaction/status tests, full KMS tests, migration
    guards, Rust quality scan, clippy, and `make pre-commit` passed.

## Phase 2 Storage API Tasks

- [x] `API-001` Add `crates/storage-api`.
  - Acceptance: `rustfs-storage-api` is a workspace member and remains a
    dependency-free contract crate.
  - Verification: `cargo check -p rustfs-storage-api`.
- [~] `API-002` Move public storage error/result contracts.
  - Current slice: add public `StorageErrorCode` and `StorageResult` contracts
    in `rustfs-storage-api`, then make ECStore `StorageError::to_u32/from_u32`
    consume the shared code table.
  - Deferred: keep the full ECStore `StorageError` enum and ECStore-specific
    conversions in `rustfs-ecstore` until the `DiskError`, filemeta, lock, and
    `std::io::Error` downcast boundary is proven safe.
  - Acceptance: storage-api contract tests pass, ECStore compatibility tests
    prove numeric codes match the new contract, and
    `cargo check -p rustfs-storage-api -p rustfs-ecstore` passes.
  - Must preserve: storage error display, conversions, object error mapping,
    quorum classification, and reserved code gaps `0x2B/0x2C`.
  - Risk defense: no storage hot-path enum move in this PR; only numeric code
    mapping uses the new contract.

## Phase 8 Background Controller Tasks

- [x] `BGC-001` Inventory background services.
  - Acceptance:
    [`background-services-inventory.md`](background-services-inventory.md)
    records scanner, heal, lifecycle, replication, config reload, metrics,
    shutdown, cancellation, and side-effect surfaces before controller work.
  - Must preserve: no code behavior change and no new controller contract in
    this PR.
  - Verification: docs-only architecture checks and diff hygiene.
- [x] `BGC-002` Define minimal controller contract.
  - Acceptance:
    [`background-controller-contract.md`](background-controller-contract.md)
    defines desired/current/status/reconcile vocabulary, status state
    semantics, service boundaries, and side-effect rules without starting
    workers or changing scheduling.
  - Must preserve: no Rust trait, scheduler, service registry, worker
    start/stop path, storage write, readiness change, peer signal, or runtime
    behavior change.
  - Verification: docs-only architecture checks and diff hygiene.

## Next PRs

1. Continue `API-002` only after reviewing whether `DiskError` and
   `std::io::Error` conversion ownership can move without orphan-rule or
   downcast behavior loss.
2. `contract`: move DTOs that are contract-only in `API-003`; keep ECStore
   implementation, KMS/SSE readers, erasure logic, and remote disk internals out
   of rustfs-storage-api.
3. `test-only`: add focused compatibility checks before moving store traits or
   consumer imports.

## Pre-Push Review Log

| Expert | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Quality/architecture | pass | rustfs-storage-api only adds `StorageErrorCode` and `StorageResult`; ECStore keeps `StorageError`, `DiskError`, filemeta, lock, and `std::io::Error` conversion ownership. |
| Migration preservation | pass | ECStore numeric conversion now consumes the shared code table while preserving old variant defaults, reserved gaps `0x2B/0x2C`, and existing display/conversion logic. |
| Testing/verification | pass | Focused storage-api and ECStore tests, cargo check, dependency guard, migration guards, Rust quality scan, `make pre-commit`, nextest, and doctests passed. |

## Verification Notes

Passed:
- `cargo fmt --all`
- `cargo fmt --all --check`
- `cargo test -p rustfs-storage-api`
- `cargo test -p rustfs-ecstore error -- --nocapture`
- `cargo check -p rustfs-storage-api -p rustfs-ecstore`
- `cargo tree -p rustfs-storage-api --edges normal`
- `./scripts/check_architecture_migration_rules.sh`
- `./scripts/check_layer_dependencies.sh`
- `./scripts/check_metrics_migration_refs.sh`
- `git diff --check`
- Rust quality scan on changed Rust files.
- `make pre-commit`
  - Full nextest: 5704 passed, 111 skipped.
  - Workspace doctests passed.

Notes:
- This branch changes Rust storage contract code and ECStore contract mapping.
- Rust quality scan reported only existing patterns in `crates/ecstore/src/error.rs`:
  a test-only `unwrap()` and the pre-existing `StorageError::other` boxed error
  boundary. This PR does not add either pattern.

## Handoff Notes

- Keep this branch as the API-002 first slice, not the full error enum move.
- Do not move `StorageError`, `DiskError`, filemeta conversion, lock conversion,
  or `std::io::Error` downcast behavior out of ECStore in this PR.
- Do not add ECStore implementation, KMS/SSE reader logic, erasure logic, or
  remote disk internals to `rustfs-storage-api`.
- Do not add temporary compatibility code without a matching
  `RUSTFS_COMPAT_TODO(<task-id>)` marker and cleanup-register entry.
