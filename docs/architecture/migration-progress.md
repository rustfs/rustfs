# Architecture Migration Progress

Status values: `[ ]` not started, `[~]` in progress, `[x]` complete, `[!]` blocked.

## Current Context

- Issue: [`rustfs/backlog#660`](https://github.com/rustfs/backlog/issues/660)
- Branch: `overtrue/arch-kms-defaults-inventory`
- Baseline: `upstream/main` at `f9a5e6d7e67322ac6f626b6f437a5e722fbe22e2`
- PR type for this branch: `docs-only`
- Runtime behavior changes: none
- Rust code changes: none
- CI/script changes: none
- Docs changes: add KMSD-001 inventory for current KMS development defaults,
  classify each default as production-safe, dev-only, or invalid for
  production, and record follow-up hardening boundaries.

## Phase 0 Tasks

- [x] `G-001` Refresh `main` and record baseline.
  - Acceptance: baseline commit, title, and branch are recorded.
  - Verification: `git fetch upstream main --prune`; `git rev-parse upstream/main`.
- [x] `G-002` Create migration tracking checklist.
  - Acceptance: this file records task state, context, verification, and handoff.
- [x] `G-003` Classify PR types.
  - Acceptance: [`crate-boundaries.md`](crate-boundaries.md) lists exactly one
    allowed PR type per PR.
- [x] `G-004` Define re-export and wrapper policy.
  - Acceptance: temporary compatibility code must use `RUSTFS_COMPAT_TODO`.
- [x] `G-005` Add dependency direction guard.
  - Acceptance: `./scripts/check_layer_dependencies.sh` passes on current
    `upstream/main` while still rejecting new unaccepted layer dependencies.
- [~] `G-006` Create migration loss-prevention checks.
  - Current branch: add a mechanical admin route matrix guard from
    [`admin-route-action-snapshot.md`](admin-route-action-snapshot.md) and
    `rustfs/src/admin/route_registration_test.rs`.
  - Remaining follow-up: add checks for public re-export and storage trait
    coverage before pure moves.
- [x] `G-007` Create startup timeline table.
  - Acceptance: [`startup-timeline.md`](startup-timeline.md) records current
    binary startup order, side effects, fatal boundaries, and readiness stages.
- [x] `G-008` Capture admin route-action snapshot.
  - Acceptance: [`admin-route-action-snapshot.md`](admin-route-action-snapshot.md)
    records current route families, handler ownership, authorization actions,
    public exceptions, table-catalog routes, and `/minio/admin` compatibility
    alias behavior.
- [x] `G-009` Enforce pre-push three-expert review.
  - Acceptance: [`crate-boundaries.md`](crate-boundaries.md) requires
    quality/architecture, migration-preservation, and testing/verification review
    before push.
- [x] `G-010` Inventory `ecstore::config::{Config, KV, KVS}` consumers.
  - Acceptance:
    [`ecstore-config-consumer-inventory.md`](ecstore-config-consumer-inventory.md)
    records the current model definitions, global accessors, persistence helpers,
    consumer groups, migration risks, and do-not-change contract.
- [x] `TEST-PRTYPE-001` Check PR type enum consistency.
  - Acceptance: `./scripts/check_architecture_migration_rules.sh` parses the
    allowed PR types from [`crate-boundaries.md`](crate-boundaries.md) and fails
    when `ARCHITECTURE.md` or architecture docs reference an unknown PR type.
- [x] `COMPAT-REG-001` Check temporary compatibility cleanup consistency.
  - Acceptance: `./scripts/check_architecture_migration_rules.sh` fails when a
    source `RUSTFS_COMPAT_TODO(<task-id>)` marker lacks a cleanup-register entry,
    when a register entry lacks a source marker, or when a source marker omits a
    removal condition.

## Phase 1 Security Governance Tasks

- [x] `S-001` Add `crates/security-governance`.
  - Acceptance: the crate is a workspace member and has no dependency on
    `rustfs`, `ecstore`, admin handlers, Axum, or runtime state.
  - Verification: `cargo check -p rustfs-security-governance`.
- [x] `S-002` Add admin route matrix core types.
  - Acceptance: `AdminRouteSpec`, `AdminRouteAccess`, `AdminActionRef`,
    `PublicRouteKind`, `RouteRiskLevel`, and validation errors model route
    governance metadata without registering routes or enforcing auth.
  - Verification: `cargo test -p rustfs-security-governance`.
- [x] `S-003` Add redaction contract types.
  - Acceptance: `RedactionRule`, `RedactionLevel`, and validation errors model
    sensitive field handling without logging, masking, or runtime integration.
  - Verification: `cargo test -p rustfs-security-governance`.
- [x] `S-004` Add serde policy marker types.
  - Acceptance: `SerdePolicy`, `SerdePolicyKind`, `UnknownFieldPolicy`, and
    validation errors model strict ingress and compatibility serde contracts
    without changing deserialization behavior.
  - Verification: `cargo test -p rustfs-security-governance`.
- [x] `S-005` Add supply-chain policy contract types.
  - Acceptance: `ArtifactIntegrityPolicy`, `ArtifactSourceKind`, and validation
    errors model digest, signature, and provenance requirements without changing
    release or CI behavior.
  - Verification: `cargo test -p rustfs-security-governance`.
- [x] `S-006` Add `rustfs/src/admin/route_policy.rs` backed by these contract
  types, without changing route registration or auth behavior.
  - Acceptance: direct `AdminRouteSpec` entries cover routes with a single
    stable admin policy action, deferred inventory records routes that need
    richer contract support, and tests prove the combined inventory covers every
    registered admin route.
- [x] `S-011` Add KMS action taxonomy.
  - Acceptance: `KmsAction` can parse and serialize dedicated configure,
    service-control, clear-cache, generate-data-key, delete, rotate, list, and
    describe actions; wildcard matching still works.
  - Verification: `cargo test -p rustfs-policy action --no-fail-fast`.
- [x] `S-012` Migrate KMS handlers to dedicated actions.
  - Acceptance: KMS data-key, delete/cancel-delete, cache, configure,
    service-control, list, and describe handlers use dedicated `kms:*` actions.
  - Compatibility: legacy KMS create/status admin actions are retained only as
    temporary compatibility paths and registered in
    [`compat-cleanup-register.md`](compat-cleanup-register.md).
  - Verification: focused handler and route policy tests, migration rules,
    formatting, and `make pre-commit`.
- [x] `S-013` Apply KMS redaction.
  - Acceptance: KMS Debug output and admin status response summaries contain no
    Vault token, AppRole secret ID, or local master key values.
  - Must preserve: internal KMS config values remain available to runtime code
    and persisted config serialization still writes the original secret values.
  - Verification: focused KMS redaction/status tests, full KMS tests, migration
    guards, Rust quality scan, clippy, and `make pre-commit` passed.
- [x] `KMSD-001` Inventory KMS development defaults.
  - Acceptance:
    [`kms-development-defaults-inventory.md`](kms-development-defaults-inventory.md)
    records Local and Vault defaults for missing master keys, temp key dirs,
    HTTP Vault addresses, default dev-token credentials, and skip-TLS behavior.
  - Must preserve: no KMS runtime behavior, config serialization,
    authorization, startup order, storage path, or crate boundary changes.
  - Verification: docs diff review, migration guards, metrics reference guard,
    and `git diff --check`.

## Phase 8 Background Controller Tasks

- [x] `BGC-001` Inventory background services.
  - Acceptance:
    [`background-services-inventory.md`](background-services-inventory.md)
    records scanner, heal, lifecycle, replication, config reload, metrics,
    shutdown, cancellation, and side-effect surfaces before controller work.
  - Must preserve: no code behavior change and no new controller contract in
    this PR.
  - Verification: docs-only architecture checks and diff hygiene.

## Next PRs

1. `contract`: define the minimal BackgroundController status vocabulary after
   the BGC-001 inventory is reviewed.
2. `test-only`: add focused preservation tests before moving scanner, heal,
   replication, lifecycle, or disk health workers.
3. `security-change`: make Local KMS unsafe defaults explicit development
   opt-ins or production failures in KMSD-002.
4. `security-change`: make Vault unsafe defaults explicit development opt-ins
   or production failures in KMSD-003.
5. `security-change`: apply IAM and plugin redaction in a separate S-014 PR.

## Pre-Push Review Log

| Expert | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Quality/architecture | pass | Single `docs-only` PR; the inventory is isolated under `docs/architecture`, uses existing KMS source files as evidence, and introduces no new abstraction or dependency edge. |
| Migration preservation | pass | No runtime code, config persistence, admin authorization, startup order, storage path, global state, or crate boundary changes are made. |
| Testing/verification | pass | Docs-only verification is bounded to diff review, architecture migration rules, metrics reference guard, layer dependency guard, and whitespace checks. |

## Verification Notes

Passed:
- `./scripts/check_architecture_migration_rules.sh`
- `./scripts/check_layer_dependencies.sh`
- `./scripts/check_metrics_migration_refs.sh`
- `git diff --check`
- `git diff --name-only -- '*.rs' 'Cargo.toml' 'Cargo.lock' '.github/**' 'Makefile' 'Justfile'`

Notes:
- This branch changes architecture documentation only.
- No Rust source, Cargo manifest, workflow, script, or runtime configuration is
  changed.
- `make pre-commit` is intentionally not required for this docs-only PR.

## Handoff Notes

- Keep this KMSD-001 branch as a focused `docs-only` PR. Do not change KMS
  defaults, admin authorization, admin route registration shape, config moves,
  Storage API moves, runtime moves, or ECStore moves.
- `rustfs` may depend on `rustfs-security-governance` for contract metadata;
  the security-governance crate must stay independent from implementation
  crates and runtime state.
- Do not add temporary compatibility code without a matching
  `RUSTFS_COMPAT_TODO(<task-id>)` marker and cleanup-register entry.
- KMS production default hardening remains a separate task group; do not bundle
  it with this inventory PR.
