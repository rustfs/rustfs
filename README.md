# Who am I? ðŸ‘‹

RustFS is a high-performance distributed object storage software built using Rust, one of the most popular languages worldwide. Along with MinIO, it shares a range of advantages such as simplicity, S3 compatibility, open-source nature, support for data lakes, AI, and big data. Furthermore, it has a better and more user-friendly open-source license in comparison to other storage systems, being constructed under the Apache license. As Rust serves as its foundation, RustFS provides faster speed and safer distributed features for high-performance object storage.

# RustFS vs other object storage

| RustFS | Other object storage|
| - | - |
| Developed based on Rust language, memory is safer | Developed in Go or C, with potential issues like memory GC/leaks |
| Does not report logs to third-party countries	 | Reporting logs to other third countries may violate national security laws |
| Licensed under Apache, more business-friendly	 | AGPL V3 License and other License, polluted open source and License traps, infringement of intellectual property rights |
| Comprehensive S3 support, works with domestic and international cloud providers	 | Full support for S3, but no local cloud vendor support |
| Rust-based development, strong support for secure and innovative devices	 | Poor support for edge gateways and secure innovative devices|
| Stable commercial prices, free community support | High pricing, with costs up to $250,000 for 1PiB |
| No risk | Intellectual property risks and risks of prohibited uses |
